# programming-puzzles
I recently came across MIT's Programming for Puzzled course by Srini Devdas. I found it to be a fun and interesting way of learning problem solving for programmers. The course discusses a dozen of puzzles and their algorithms, solutions in Python. I have been programming in Golang for about 6 months. I thought exploring this course in Golang would be a great way to get started with problem solving in Golang. 

I will try my best to describe the problem and the solutions in a language neutral way and then provide the solutions in Golang. Further, I will explore the possible variation of the problem and how that will impact the solution approach. Hopefully this will benefit the people looking for fun ways to learn programming for problem solving along with me.
